NOT ready for prime time bridge building.

Very fragile, not simple to use robot to create:

- 3 block wide bridge
- in all directions


use : 
!build <direction> <amount>

direction = one of north, south, east, west

amount = amount of blocks. Note: 300 blocks is 100 blocks long.


TODO:
- ability to sleep
- ability to dump inventory in chest
